# WeWeb Auth

The WeWeb Auth plugin requires minimum configuration. 

## Step 1: Configuration

You may leave these settings by default. 

If you double click on the configuration options, you'll see the template emails that are sent out when you invite new users to join. If you need to change those template emails, please use the "contact us" link or in-app chat to let us know.

## Step 2: Define Redirections (URLs)

In step 2, select the page you want users to be redirected to when they are *not* signed in. 

For example, a sign in page.

That's it. That's all it takes to add the WeWeb Auth plugin ðŸ™Œ

## Step 3: Add Users, Manage Roles & Permissions

Once you've added the WeWeb Auth plugin, you will be able to:

* add users, manage roles, and user group permissions in the "User" menu in the topbar
* allow users to signup, signin, signout, and reset their password <a href="https://docs.weweb.io/weweb-authentication" target="_blank" class="ww-editor-link">using WeWeb Auth forms & workflows</a>
