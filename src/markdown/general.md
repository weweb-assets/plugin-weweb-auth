# WeWeb Auth

Perfect for proof-of-concept apps with basic auth needs.

Features:
- No-code authentication workflows
- Basic user roles and permissions
- UI kit for forms (login, signup, forgot password)

âš  Note:
The WeWeb Auth plugin is ideal for testing but not for apps that need to scale or implement complex permissions.

Plugin limitations include:
- Max 20 signup emails/day.
- Max 20 password recovery emails/day.
- No backend user sync.

To build a secure app that scales, we recommend you use:
- one of our native integrations (e.g. Xano Auth, Supabase Auth, Auth0), or
- one of our backend-agnostic plugins (e.g. token-based auth, OpenID).
